# CornClient
A small client useful for a variety of tasks ranging from raiding to duping.

Note: Always use this with another client, this client is not good enough (yet) to be used single handed

# Installation
Since so many people ask me how to build this and cant read apparently, I will say the following

**YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUILD IT YOURSELF. READ [How to obtain the mod without building](https://github.com/AriliusClient/CornClient/wiki/How-to-obtain-the-mod-without-building%3F) TO DOWNLOAD A PREBUILD**

If you want to contribute or really build it yourself, [read this](https://github.com/AriliusClient/CornClient/wiki/Building-and-contributing)

## Building
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the new folder in your terminal
3. `./gradlew build`
4. Jarfile will be in build/libs, ccl-(version).jar

## Prebuilds
The prebuild jarfile can be found in build/libs.


After you obtained the jarfile, put it into your mods folder in your fabric installation for any minecraft version. Fabric API is needed.
