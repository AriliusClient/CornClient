# Installation

## Easy installation
You can use the [cornos installer](https://github.com/AriliusClient/cornos-installer/releases) to easily install this mod. If you wish to control everything yourself tho, keep reading.

Since so many people ask me how to build this and cant read apparently, I will say the following

**YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUILD IT YOURSELF.
READ [How to obtain the mod without building](https://github.com/AriliusClient/CornClient/wiki/How-to-obtain-the-mod-without-building%3F)
TO DOWNLOAD A PRE-BUILT JAR**

If you want to contribute or really build it yourself, [read this](https://github.com/AriliusClient/CornClient/wiki/Building-and-contributing)

## Installing the jarfile
1. Install the [fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) 
2. Drag the jar file and the [fabric api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to `(Minecraft folder)/mods`. If there is no `mods` folder, create one.<br>Side note: you may have selected a custom installation path for the fabric launcher profile. If that's the case, use that folder as minecraft folder.
3. Launch fabric using your launcher of choice.

## Building
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the new folder in your terminal
3. `./gradlew build`
4. Jarfile will be in build/libs, ccl-(version).jar

## Prebuilds

The prebuilt jarfile can be found in the `builds` folder.

After you obtained the jarfile, read the section above, "Installing the jarfile".
